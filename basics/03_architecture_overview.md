# ELK Architecture Overview

This chapter covers the overall architecture of the ELK Stack, explaining how the different components interact with one another to form a complete logging and analytics system.

## Basic ELK Stack Architecture

At its core, the ELK Stack follows a simple data flow:

1. **Collection**: Log data is collected from various sources
2. **Processing**: Data is parsed, transformed, and enriched
3. **Storage**: Processed data is stored in a searchable format
4. **Analysis**: Data is queried, analyzed, and visualized

## Component Interactions

### Data Ingestion Flow

The typical flow of data through the ELK Stack is:

1. **Sources** → **Beats/Logstash** → **Elasticsearch** → **Kibana**

However, variations exist depending on requirements:

- **Sources** → **Beats** → **Elasticsearch** → **Kibana**
- **Sources** → **Beats** → **Logstash** → **Elasticsearch** → **Kibana**
- **Sources** → **Elasticsearch** (direct ingestion) → **Kibana**

### Role of Each Component

#### Data Collection (Beats/Logstash)

- **Beats**: Lightweight data shippers that collect specific types of data
  - Installed directly on servers and edge devices
  - Send data to Logstash or directly to Elasticsearch
  - Minimal processing capabilities

- **Logstash**: Heavy-duty data processing pipeline
  - Ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously
  - Performs complex transformations and enrichment
  - Sends processed data to one or more destinations

#### Data Storage (Elasticsearch)

- Stores all ingested data in indices
- Provides near real-time search capabilities
- Handles the analytics computations
- Manages data distribution and redundancy across the cluster

#### Data Visualization (Kibana)

- Provides a web interface to search and visualize data
- Creates dashboards for monitoring and analysis
- Manages access to Elasticsearch features
- Handles user authentication and authorization

## Common Architecture Patterns

### Small-Scale Architecture

Suitable for development, testing, or small production workloads:

- Single node with all components installed
- Limited redundancy and scalability
- Lower resource requirements

### Medium-Scale Architecture

Suitable for most production workloads:

- 3-5 node Elasticsearch cluster
- Dedicated Logstash servers
- Beats installed on all application servers
- Kibana with load balancer

### Large-Scale Architecture

Suitable for enterprise-level deployments:

- 10+ node Elasticsearch cluster with dedicated roles
  - Master nodes for cluster management
  - Data nodes for storing data
  - Ingest nodes for preprocessing
  - Coordinating nodes for load balancing
- Logstash server pools with load balancing
- Multiple Kibana instances behind a load balancer
- Distributed Beats configuration management

### Hot-Warm-Cold Architecture

Optimizes storage costs based on data age:

- **Hot nodes**: SSD-backed nodes for recent, frequently accessed data
- **Warm nodes**: HDD-backed nodes for older, less frequently accessed data
- **Cold nodes**: Low-cost storage for archival data
- **Frozen tier**: For rarely accessed data, stored on object storage

## Network Considerations

- **Firewall Rules**: Specific ports need to be open between components
  - Elasticsearch: 9200 (HTTP), 9300 (transport)
  - Logstash: 5044 (Beats input), 9600 (monitoring)
  - Kibana: 5601 (web interface)

- **Load Balancing**: Important for high-availability setups
  - HAProxy or Nginx for Kibana
  - Load balancers for Elasticsearch API endpoints

- **Network Latency**: Components should ideally be in the same data center or region
  - Cross-region replication for disaster recovery

## Security Architecture

Modern ELK Stack deployments include several security layers:

- **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: Encrypts communication between components
- **Authentication**: Verifies user identities using internal users, LDAP, or SSO
- **Authorization**: Controls access to indices and features using role-based access control
- **Encryption**: Protects data at rest
- **Audit Logging**: Tracks system access and operations

## Advanced Architecture Components

### Cross-Cluster Replication (CCR)

- Replicates indices across clusters
- Provides disaster recovery and data locality

### Ingest Pipelines

- Lightweight data processing directly in Elasticsearch
- Alternative to Logstash for simpler transformations

### Machine Learning

- Anomaly detection nodes
- Job management and results storage

### Alerting

- Watches for specific conditions in your data
- Triggers notifications when conditions are met

## Container-Based Architecture

ELK Stack components can be deployed as containers:

- Docker containers for development and small deployments
- Kubernetes for production-scale deployments
- Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) for managed Kubernetes deployments

## Cloud vs. On-Premises Architecture

### Cloud-Based Architecture

- Elastic Cloud (managed service by Elastic)
- Self-managed on AWS, GCP, Azure
- Hybrid deployments with cross-cluster capabilities

### On-Premises Architecture

- Traditional hardware deployment
- Virtualized environment
- Private cloud deployment

## Typical Resource Requirements

Understanding resource requirements is crucial for planning:

| Component | CPU | Memory | Storage | Network |
|-----------|-----|--------|---------|---------|
| Elasticsearch (per node) | 8-32 cores | 32-64 GB | 500GB-2TB | 1-10 Gbps |
| Logstash | 4-8 cores | 8-16 GB | 50-100 GB | 1-10 Gbps |
| Kibana | 2-4 cores | 4-8 GB | 20-50 GB | 1 Gbps |
| Beats (per server) | 1-2 cores | 0.5-1 GB | 1-5 GB | 100 Mbps |

These are general guidelines and actual requirements depend on workload, data volume, and performance expectations.

In the next chapter, we'll walk through setting up a basic ELK Stack to get hands-on experience with these components.
