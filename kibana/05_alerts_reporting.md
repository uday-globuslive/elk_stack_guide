## Kibana Alerting Overview

Kibana Alerting provides a centralized management system for detecting conditions in your data and triggering actions when those conditions are met.

### Key Alerting Concepts

- **Rules**: Definitions of conditions to monitor
- **Actions**: What happens when rule conditions are met
- **Connectors**: Integrations with external systems for notifications
- **Alerts**: Individual instances of rule conditions being met

### Alerting Architecture

Kibana Alerting consists of several components:

1. **Alerting Framework**: Core system for managing rules and actions
2. **Rule Types**: Plugins that define specific alert conditions
3. **Action Types**: Plugins that define notification methods
4. **Alert UI**: Interface for creating and managing alerts
5. **Task Manager**: Background service for checking alert conditions

### Licensing Requirements

Alerting features vary by license level:

- **Basic License**:
  - Index threshold alerts
  - Limited connectors (email, Slack)
  - Basic alert management

- **Gold/Platinum/Enterprise License**:
  - Advanced rule types
  - Additional connectors
  - Alert tagging and categorization
  - Rule templates

## Alert Types and Rules

### Built-in Rule Types

Kibana includes several rule types for common scenarios:

- **Index Threshold**: Alert when field values meet specific conditions
- **Metrics Threshold**: Alert on metrics data
- **Geo-Containment**: Alert when objects enter/exit areas
- **Anomaly Detection**: Alert on ML job anomalies
- **Uptime Monitoring**: Alert on service availability
- **Error Rate**: Alert when error rates exceed thresholds
- **Inventory Threshold**: Alert on infrastructure metrics
- **APM**: Alert on application performance issues
- **SIEM**: Alert on security threats

### Rule Parameters

Common parameters across rule types:

1. **Conditions**: Specific thresholds or criteria
2. **Time Period**: When and how often to check
3. **Run Interval**: Frequency of condition evaluation
4. **Look-back Interval**: Time window for data analysis
5. **Notifications**: When and how to send alerts

### Example: Index Threshold Rule

Parameters for an index threshold rule:

```yaml
Name: High Error Rate Alert
Tags: [production, errors]
Index: logs-*
Time Field: @timestamp
Condition:
  Aggregation: count()
  Group By: [service.name]
  Condition: is above
  Threshold: 100
  Time Window: 5m
Trigger:
  Actions: Send email, Create incident
  Frequency: Alert on each check
  Throttle: 1 hour
```

### Advanced Rule Logic

Create sophisticated alerting logic:

1. **Compound Conditions**:
   - Multiple thresholds
   - AND/OR logic
   - Condition sequences

2. **Grouping**:
   - Group alerts by fields
   - Alert per group instance
   - Group-specific thresholds

3. **Recovery Alerts**:
   - Notify when conditions resolve
   - Track alert state
   - Calculate recovery time

## Creating and Managing Alerts

### Creating a New Rule

Steps to create an alert rule:

1. Navigate to **Stack Management > Rules and Connectors > Rules**
2. Click **Create rule**
3. Select a rule type
4. Configure rule parameters:
   - Define rule conditions
   - Set check interval
   - Specify time window
5. Configure actions:
   - Select action types
   - Define recipients
   - Customize messages
6. Review and save the rule

### Rule Management Interface

Manage rules through the Kibana UI:

1. **Rules List**:
   - View all rules
   - Filter by type, tags, status
   - Bulk operations

2. **Rule Details**:
   - Status and health
   - Last run time
   - Current state
   - Alert history

3. **Rule Actions**:
   - Edit rule
   - Disable/enable rule
   - Delete rule
   - Run rule now (manual trigger)

### Rule Status and Health

Monitor rule operational status:

1. **Status Types**:
   - OK: Rule is working normally
   - Warning: Rule has non-critical issues
   - Error: Rule cannot execute properly
   - Disabled: Rule is manually disabled

2. **Health Metrics**:
   - Execution time
   - Success rate
   - Resource usage
   - Failure reasons

### Example: Creating a CPU Alert

Creating a rule for high CPU usage:

1. Select "Metrics threshold" rule type
2. Configure parameters:
   ```
   Name: High CPU Alert
   Check every: 1 minute
   Source: metrics-*
   Metrics:
     Aggregation: max
     Field: system.cpu.user.pct
   Condition: is above
   Threshold: 80%
   Group by: host.name
   ```
3. Add actions:
   - Email notification
   - Slack message
   - Create JIRA ticket
