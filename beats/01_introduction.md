# Introduction to Beats

## What are Beats?

Beats are lightweight, single-purpose data shippers that collect and send data from hundreds or thousands of machines to Logstash or Elasticsearch. Developed by Elastic, Beats are designed to be efficient, consuming minimal resources while reliably gathering operational data.

Unlike Logstash, which is a more general-purpose data processing pipeline with a larger footprint, Beats are specialized agents focused on specific data sources. This specialization allows Beats to be extremely lightweight and efficient.

## The Beats Family

The Beats family includes multiple specialized shippers:

### Filebeat

**Purpose**: Collects and ships log files

## Beats Architecture

### Component Model

Each Beat follows a similar architecture:

1. **Input**: Collects data from a specific source
2. **Processing**: Filters, enhances, and structures the data
3. **Output**: Ships the processed data to a destination

This pipeline is optimized for the specific data type each Beat handles, making it more efficient than a general-purpose solution.

### Resource Efficiency

Beats are designed to be extremely resource-efficient:

- **Low Memory Footprint**: Typically uses only a few MB of memory
- **Minimal CPU Usage**: Optimized for specific data collection tasks
- **Small Disk Footprint**: Binary size of a few MB
- **Autoscaling**: Automatically adapts to system load

### Data Flow Architecture

Beats can be deployed in various topologies:

#### Direct to Elasticsearch

Beats → Elasticsearch → Kibana

The simplest architecture, where Beats send data directly to Elasticsearch:
- Suitable for smaller deployments
- Less complex to manage
- Limited data transformation capabilities
- Relies on Elasticsearch ingest pipelines for processing

#### Via Logstash

Beats → Logstash → Elasticsearch → Kibana

A more flexible architecture with enhanced processing capabilities:
- Better handling of complex data transformations
- Buffering for handling load spikes
- Advanced filtering and enrichment
- Multiple output destinations

#### Centralized Configuration

Elasticsearch → Beats → Logstash → Elasticsearch → Kibana

Advanced setup with centralized configuration:
- Manage configuration for thousands of Beats instances
- Update configurations without manual intervention
- Monitor Beat status and performance
- Apply consistent policies across your infrastructure

## Beats Common Features
